We\u2019re back, and we\u2019re even bigger and better than before!<br><br></>\u200bPolterkitty (@spookycat27) and Director Morty (@HPM, aka Gikkle) will be hosting this mafia game.<br>Specifications are below.<br>For information on how to play the game of mafia, you can visit the Hypixel Mafia Hub:<br>Link to the Hub<br>\u200b<br>Spoiler: IMPORTANT, RELEVANT INFORMATION<br>*Neither moderator is responsible for death or dismemberment that may occur as a result of signing up for the mafia game.<br>[Below is subject to change if the planned player count is not reached]<br>The way this game is set up is a little funky. We don\u2019t want this game to take a very long time, or drag on at all. Thus, we\u2019ve changed the way some of the core mechanics work.<br>Day phases (APART FROM DAY 1) have TWO lynches & any day phase with 2 lynches lasts 72 hrs.<br>Night phases are normal, lasting 24 hours.<br>FAQ:<br>Q: How will MYLO/LYLO situations interact with such a lynch setup?<br>A: It wholly depends on the numbers. If it would be MYLO/LYLO with ONE lynch, then the game reverts to one lynch & MYLO will be announced. If it is MYLO/LYLO with TWO lynches (if the town can lose after that day phase w/ two town lynches), then the game will revert to ONE lynch, and MY/LYLO will NOT be announced. Put in numbers:<br>- 2 goons, 6 townies. 2v6 in 2 lynches can only be a worst case 2v3, and thus it will be 2 lynches<br>- 2 goons, 5 townies. A worst case results in a 2v2 the next morning, and thus the game will be 1 lynch with no MY/LYLO announcement<br>- 2 goons, 4 townies. Worst case results in a 2v1, thus the game reverts to a single lynch. However, the second check for MYLO/LYLO also passes (as worst case single lynch is 2v2 MYLO), so MYLO will be announced.<br>-<br>Q: That\u2019s nice to know, but how is MYLO/LYLO calculated?<br>A: The calculation is as follows:<br>Assume the setup allows for single lynches only.\u200b<br>Assume the worst case for town, given all the roles.\u200b<br>Any and all neutral(s), apart from killing, that is(are) not wincon-bound to town joins the Mafia team.*\u200b<br>Would the mafia win over the night phase, given a no exe? If so, announce LYLO.\u200b<br>Would the mafia win over the night phase, given a town exe? If so, announce MYLO.\u200b<br>If neither is true, assume two town are lynched during the day. Would the mafia win over the night phase? If so, the day phase becomes a single lynch.\u200b<br>*Note: This means the game may not strictly end if the town has exe\u2019d incorrectly.<br>-<br>Q: Alright, but what about the whole role shenanigans? What\u2019s the Order of Operations (OOO)?<br>A: We\u2019re not going to provide the OOO\u2013however, we will divulge that we crafted one based on the default OOO* specifically for this setup.<br>*Day actions (unless otherwise specified)<br>Lynch<br>NIGHT START<br>Commuters commute<br>PGO goes on alert<br>Strongman actions<br>Hiders hide<br>Redirections redirect<br>Roleblocks roleblock<br>Rolestops do their thing<br>Jailings jail<br>Protections protect<br>Kills kill<br>Recruitments recruit<br>Investigations investigate<br>Misc actions occur (unless otherwise specified)<br>DAY START<br>-<br>Q: Votecounts. How are y\u2019all gonna handle those?<br>A: We\u2019ve got a schedule for \u2018em. On a two lynch day, official mod VCs should be expected at or around (within a reasonable amount of time) 48 hours before lynch, 24 hours, 4, 2, and 1 hr. However, it\u2019s worth noting that hammers may mess up times (we\u2019ve not decided if we\u2019re locking in day start and end times or not) & we reserve the right to change this schedule wherever we need.<br>Unofficial VCs may come at any time.<br>-<br>Q: Alright, how do I vote?<br>A: On one lynch days it\u2019s as normal ( [VOTE] (player) [/VOTE] ). On two lynch days, however, the default tags are attributed to lynch 1, and you must use [VOTE2] (player) [/VOTE2] in order to put your second vote on a different player.<br>-<br>Q: Tie mechanic? Same player on the stand twice?<br>A: The tie mechanic is randomization. If the same player is voted to be lynched twice, we\u2019ll instead kill a random town-aligned player.<br>-<br>Q: I need a segway to rapid fire some more things.<br>A:<br>Flavor is alignment AND role indicative.\u200b<br>Anti-town players get fake flavors, but they do NOT get fake claims.\u200b<br>Flavor claiming is not advised.\u200b<br>Discord is not required, but highly recommended.\u200b<br>Anything in a spoiler marked as NOT GAME RELATED is NOT GAME RELATED.\u200b<br>Gikkle and I will NOT lie to you!\u200b<br>Duplicates are possible.\u200b<br>This is a closed setup, role madness game.\u200b<br><br>Spoiler: How do I sign up?<br>Just reply to the thread with /in if you\u2019re able to meet the demanding requirements of this game of mafia. You may also /backup if you wish to be a replacement for someone later in the game who does not meet the activity requirements. The requirements are at least SIX posts on D1, and at least NINE on every day after that.<br>Also, it would be helpful to us mods if you give us an indication of how much you know about Luigi\u2019s Mansion as a whole.<br>Lastly, if you have a role/alignment request, shoot it to Gikkle and I either on discord or here on the forums. We will not guarantee that any requests will be honored.<br><br>Spoiler: Rules<br>1. Do not copy paste, screenshot, or otherwise quote from any PMs created by either of us.<br>2.
