{"listofpostsA": [["mortadella", 1, "Welcome to Hypixel Mafia LXVI: ChatGPT Edition!<br><br>In this Mafia game, we'll be exploring the wonderful world of ChatGPT, the newest craze. All game mechanics will have something to do with AI generation. Will this be a bastard game? Will it be balanced? Will it be swingy? All this and more will be decided by our new AI overlords.<br>For all general rules and information, please check out the hub thread.<br>To join this game, simply reply /in. The game will begin in exactly a week, at 9PM CST 2/21.<br>Spoiler: Game Mechanics <br>1. Day lasts 48 hours, night lasts 24.<br>2. Flavors will not be alignment or role type indicative.<br>3. At the beginning of the game, all players are assigned a role type. This role type will be the basis of future additions to your role.<br>4. Every phase, that is, every night and every day, all players may submit a certain amount of key words in their PM, for example \"Trapper, killing\". The amount of words will be specified in your role PM. These key words will be given to ChatGPT, who will decide how your role will behave during the upcoming phase. Note that ChatGPT will often give you something entirely unexpected, and even counterintuitive. Changes to your role are permanent unless ChatGPT removes them.  The AI rules all.<br>5. Everyone begins the game as vanilla with an underlying role type, e.g. killing, supportive, protective, utility, etc. As your role changes, it may go beyond the scope of the role type, but it will never fully become another role type entirely.<br>6. Mafia will have tools in their arsenal to mess with town's key word submissions.<br>7. See Order of Operations for when Key Words are submitted and processed.<br>8. There will be AI generated events for every day phase, and possibly night phase if the AI wills it.<br><br>Spoiler: Flavor<br>\"I just can't figure it out.\"<br>\"Figure what out?\"<br>\"How to get people to like me, y'know?

In addition to what I've already said, I've melded with a few of their takes and I think that what they've picked up on their radar is towny.

I get the feeling she was genuinely excited to reveal her cards with the fish and come out of it with significant information but couldn't wait. The fish itself was also towny.<br>Kylo: I've posted about this read before. I still believe that they genuinely slipped how many keywords they have, and they have a generally innocent tone.<br>Blaze: The claim is good, his posts feel genuine, and I doubt he's being coached.
